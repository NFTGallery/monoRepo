## NFTGallery.Finance

The NFTG is a decentralized group of curators that have governance over the digtial gallery hosted at NFTGallery.Finance

The NFTG token grants voting over proposals made to the community. 

The NFTG community's primary function is to vote on potential NFT's for consignment so the NFT Gallery is able to turn a profit.  

The profit from auctioning NFT's will be used to buy back NFTG and burn the tokens to reduce the supply. 

The NFT Gallery is owned and curated by the community. 



The MAX SUPPLY of NFTG is 2222222 (2.2M)

You can harvest with 85% locked for 6 months and distributed monthly over 2 years.

This prevents dumping of NFTG with more traditonal vesting terms.
